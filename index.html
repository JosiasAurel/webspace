    <h1>Hallo! Ich heiße Josias 👾</h1>
	<p>I live in Cameroon and spend most of my time hacking together weird, useful, or slightly broken things. I work at <a href="https://hackclub.com/">Hack Club</a> (aka The Hack Foundation), where I write open-source software and run grant programs that help teenagers learn to code — mostly by encouraging them to make stuff and share it.</p>
	
	<p>My curiosity tends to pull me in strange directions and down weird rabbit holes. Sometimes it looks like implementing a brainfuck compiler in Zig, other times it's reading about agency and how it relates to human behaviour. I stretch as far as my mind takes me.</p>
	
	<p>Outside of code, I’m usually chasing a tennis ball 🎾, wandering off on hikes ⛰️, or helping run research at <a href="https://theameaarchives.com/">Amea</a>. I also co-organize events like the <a href="https://ticsummit.org/">TiC Summit</a> and <a href="https://www.open-dreams.org/odsa2025-applications">Open Dreams Summer Academy</a>.
</p>

	
	<p>You can reach me at <a href="mailto:hey@josiasw.dev">hey@josiasw.dev</a>, or poke around my <a href="https://github.com/josiasaurel">GitHub</a> if you’re curious what I’ve been hacking on.</p>
