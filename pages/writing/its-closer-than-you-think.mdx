It takes a lot of effort for one to accept his/her problems, to do what what seems impossible.
Fortunately, for those who have learned to just accept whatever life throws at us and deal with it, also know that nothing worthwhile comes without a little bit of _suffering_ and or _struggle_.

Over the couple of months that passed, I learned so much from myself and from others.
I am forever grateful for all those I have met, friends I have and my family.
It feels releaving/beautiful to have people you love and who love you, accepting you for who you are.

This day is very special because it marks the day **Christ** ascends to **Heaven**.
As for me, it marks a new start. Constant learning and improvement to get closer to what I want.
I feel very lucky to have been able to wake up today and share this thoughts of mine.

Over his lifetime Jesus showed _empathy_, _humility_ and _brotherhood_.
He gave more than he took and [did the impossible](https://www.bible.com/bible/68/MAT.4.1-11.GNT).
This is proof that nothing is impossible with him with us.

The holy bible teaches us so much of the ways to live our lives. So much that having a grasp of the
principles of living in the scriptures make everything else seem simply _not new_.

It simply makes sense to [smile even in the hardest moments](https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/68/pro.17.22).
It simple makes sense to, when every body else is giving up, to give you're all in - because it's precisely at that point that
the [difference lies](https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/68/pro.24.10).

We tend to try hard to fit in society - to find our place amongst humans that we forget to look up
to [what comes after](https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/68/ROM.1.GNT#:~:text=28Because%20those,who%20do%20them.) - and that we were born to standout.

I learned from a friend that it is possible to _drown a fish_, quite not literaly - but one thing for
sure is that it is possible to mislead yourself. I did it ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

It took the form of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Trying to put in professionalism and perfectionism was definitely not a good idea.
FOMO hit me so hard that I forgot most importantly to have fun and to just not give a f\*\*\* about what others think of you.
A single step backwards was enough put things back at their right place and to just have fun.

The world of today is so full of distractions that we forget the best of bests,
in all aspects you might think of, is _closer than you think_.

...and little drop of something stupid but fun too ;)
