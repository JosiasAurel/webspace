_I'm the greatest joke of the day_

> Warning: This is a brain dump.

Eighteen years ago, today I came to this world, two months earlier than science considers the optimal age for a mature child to breath fresh air.
Despite many challenges, I made it fine.

I can't help but thank all those who have been with me throughout my journey, think about all what I've learned and dream about all I want to achieve in the upcoming years.

I want to thank my family for supporting (and who continues to) throughout my life. I love my family!

s/o to 

- Mom for taking care of us at all times
- Dad for working so hard

and bro and sis...

Big thanks to all of you as well who have helped me be myself, grow as a person and just have fun.
These come out of letters from my 17 y/o self and while it may be awkward, just pretend you understand everthing ;)

- Gerard, thanks for pushing me (and showing me) how to study in early secondary school 
- Winnie, thanks for pushing me to learn things that were beyond my level. I failed many times but regardless, I did pretty amazing.
- Kaizy, thanks for being being kind and inspiring to set my limits in accordance with Christianity.
- Wilfried, for being so understanding and helping me feel relaxed 
- Kitten (Grace), thanks for being the cat of a bird -- if that makes any sense. It's so relieving to have a cat ready to crash a little birdie for no reason.

...And many more of you

- James for being my first friend and being a great & supportive friend for all these years
- Kana for being so jovial all the time. Like your smiley face.
- Erna for being super harsh. I know someone soft is hiding in there.
- Berenice for listening to others.
- Bill, for opening up so many opportunities for teaching and inspiring teens to pursue what they love doing. 
- All the friends I made during EPOCH and the HackClub community. It was a great experience!
- Zach, thanks for having started such an amazing community at HackClub -- we need clubs everywhere.

## Thoughts?

I've learned most recently that nothing worthwhile is achieved easily. There are always challenges and set backs -- you have to face them. If you genuinely want something, go for it.

You gain nothing from scrolling through your feed __all the time__. I once entered and a taxi and a passenger said; "these guys are distracting you with their 'perfect life' you fools" -- welp not exactly but you get it.

Rather than _trying_ to be who you dream of being, behave like you already are and the change will follow.

Of all "productivity/<INSERT_WHATEVER_THING_YOU_WANT>" book I've read, the "secrets" are in the Bible already.

An email to myself, inspired from a message a friend sent.
> "For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities —his eternal power and divine nature —have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse".
That regardless of how wonderful and mind-boggling God's creation is -- humans, animals, plants, the solar system -- we are yet to truly acknowledge his righteousness and his desire for us to be saved.
I think it is okay to appreciate the work of other people and be inspired by it. But becoming followers of the people who may inspire or those you appreciate their work is plain wrong and ignorant.


April fools!
