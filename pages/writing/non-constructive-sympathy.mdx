One of the habits that I acquired while in high school is learning to sympathize with our misdoings and errors and then doing nothing about them. 

Sympathy is a positive feeling to have especially among your friends but if you commit an error and you don't work on doing fewer errors, something is wrong right?

It's something I did in high school over and over again with my company. It's not like I couldn't help myself but I was explicitly not working on improving myself regularly — something I regret.

Fast-forward a few months since I graduated, I realise I am not the only one out of my school that seems to have this habit or to have gone through this. I have friends that seem to sympathize over their errors and complain often but don't do anything to improve. I realised this has been happening for a long time now on my way home yesterday as I was running through the activities I did. 

It usually follows the structure
_Friend 1_: "I didn't do X and I feel bad about it"
_Friend 2_: "**At least** you did W, _insert worst situation_" (to make Friend 1 feel less shitty)
_Friend 1_: *feels less bad about their mistake*
*laughs*
*moves on without really improving or getting help*


I don't know where all of this started from but I think breaking from this is going to be a slow process involving awareness and more helping one another.

And I've to begin by unlearning this behaviour.
