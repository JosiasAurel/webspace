              I spend a disproportionate amount of time on my computer coding, reading psychology articles, creating digital art, watching anime or computing the {(1 / (8.1 * 10e9)).toPrecision(3)} probability of you reading this page.

              I'm the nerdy adventurous type always following my curiosity.

              I'm a full-time Hack Club HQ member working on a variety of projects across hardware, AI, game dev and web dev.

          At Hack Club, I work on engineering projects across game dev, web dev, systems and machine learning with an <a href="https://hackclub.com/team/">incredible team</a>. Most of our work in Open Source under <a href="https://github.com/hackclub">github.com/hackclub</a>.
          <br />
          <br />
          On the side, I'm currently building a plaform for creative exploration called <a href="https://play.withdoodle.app/">Doodle</a> and an e-commerce platform called <b>Baskket</b>.
          <br />
          <br />
          Before joining Hack Club HQ full-time, I worked on a variety of projects such as <a href="https://sinerider.com/">SineRider </a>, organised a hackathon in my local town called <a href="https://ticsummit.org/">TiC Summit</a>, and worked as a software engineer at a local e-commerce startup developing administrative type software.
          <br />
          <br />
          I graduated high-school in 2022 and yet to go to college. After graduating high-school, I joined <a href="https://www.open-dreams.org/">Open Dreams</a> where I got to meet a community of incredibly talented people and curious people.
