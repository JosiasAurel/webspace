            I'm <strong>Josias Aurel,</strong>
            a curiosity-driven <u>hacker</u> from Cameroon.
            Ever since I wrote my fist RPG game in windows batch script, 
            I've done a bit of coding from writing a simple OS kernel and small games to building full-stack web applications
            and machine learning models.

        I'm that guy who likes taking apart things and and building random projects <i>just because it's fun</i> â€” and to quench my insatiable curiosity.

        Throughout my journey, I mostly worked solo on a few side projects such as <a href="https://linksbook.vercel.app/">LinksBook</a> (now terminated).   
        I also worked at a local startup for about four months (Nov, 2022 - Feb 2023) where we built an online e-commerce marketplace similar to Amazon.

        These days I'm mostly working on <a href="https://lingua.josiasw.dev/">Linguana</a> â€” a project that aims
        at creating an accessible learning platform for learning Cameroons's local languages â€” and <a href="https://tinker.quest/">Doodle (or Tinker Quest?)</a> â€” an interactive learning environment
        that makes it easier for the curious mind to explore/experiment ideas quickly.
