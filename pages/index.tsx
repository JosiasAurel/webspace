        I'm just a guy who likes writing code and exploring new technologies and concepts.
        I have a particular itch for trying new things and building random projects that pop in my mind.
        Sometimes they work, other times they don't -- but it's fun regardless.
        <br />
        These days I'm more into systems programming, game dev and artificial intelligence. Game development and machine learning
        particularly attracts me because of the maths. I am not very good, but it's fun to see mathematics in action.

        At the moment, I am working on a platform that encourages playful exploration while learning.
        <br />
        I have always enjoyed learning in a playful or explorative way. Some <a href="https://experiments.josiasw.dev/">not-so-good-experiments</a>.
        <br />
        There are a few more I made while in high school (which I graduated in 2022) but they were never published.
        I craved for more but having to bake a new cake for every new experiment did not sound all that fun to me.
        <br />
        So, I began building <a href="https://doodle.josiasw.dev/">Doodle</a> which I intend to show friends on April 1 (which is my birthday btw UwU).
        This is likely the 5th iteration from scratch which -- as crazy as I am -- I'm trying to hack within a one-month period and share. Let's see how it goes.
