# This is surreal

When you encounter a _dumb_ person, what do you do ? Does it depend on what you understand by a dumb person ?
It's pointless!

Let us now talk about **lude**. Don't worry about who he is, let's focus on what he has done... A summary.

Lude is a boy to begin with and he is a closed, hypertended and mentally disturbed person. He grew up in an environment he did not understand at all. He had always been in wonders about his environment. Everyday even when a baby, he will wonder about his surroundings. "What is this thing? Why does it have this shape? Is it alive? ..." Lude used to ask himself in his mind.

Lude spent all of his days in his mind asking himself a thousand questions abouthis life and his surroundings. To him, the world and himself was _bizzare_. It almost made no sense to him why he existed in this world.
Again unfortunately for Lude, he grew up in an environment with violence and sometimes cries.
Time passed by while his curiosity grew up like a plant, he felt more and more the need to do something about all his thoughts.

Sensible and emotional to anything, every little thing that will cause a hurt to lude came like the worst pain. All he felt is to hit up something/someone around him to releave his inner pains.

Very fast, he grew and started feeling some kind of sensation, what you call an emotion, in his heart. It was not the first time he felt that but that was while watching a cartoon ;)

"If i could have the luck to feel this kind of a thing with someone real"

What he asked for came by faster than he could realise. "Oh what is this ?", no idea! But it was nice to have it.
He rushed to do something about it.

Lude had a best friend. He will do all kinds of promises with him and even reveal some of his secrets.
The day he revealed his wonderful sensation, it blew up to all of his other classmates like a virus.

Pshsh... We are discovered, retreat!

Nah he did not but she got aware but did not say anything.

One such morning at the end of a saturday class, packing their backpacks to head home, lude was left alone with her. She asked of the rumour was true.
Silence sounded like noise. He did not say a single rational thing?!
As they walked their way home, she asked once more but he skipped it again. It then passed by.

# Exams or regrets ?

Both ? Life is unpredictable and has quirks. All you have to do is live it to the fullest, try to fullfill your ultimate goal because it will make you happy.

Lude had not set a goal yet. Lude and his mates were preparing for their graduation exams to in secondary school. He wrote pretty well. The exam passed like a breeze and the last day came. It would be the last they he would see her as they were moving to different schools. He burning wanted to tell her something, but he shyed away like always.

Fast enough, he moved to secondary school. There met new mates and made his first friend within a week. He was then transfered to another class. Like most shy people, he was a little too closed but was a sci-fi boy. His mind was enough for him, he did not need friends right?

His benchamate was a female at the time. Seeing how closed and sad?! he looked like always in his weird thoughts, she decided to play with him. She did so for some days. Sometimes passed by and he met new friends. His new friends were going to change his academic life, but he did not know that. Spending sometime with them, they built in him the habit to study more than he did. It worked! When he moved to the next class, he had to be amongst the best students in his class.

# What the heck are you doin ?

He was a boy for sure. He did not know what he did someday but something happened. He did not know it was going to hurt and teach him some lessons.
His _magical sensation_ became confused into different kind of stuff! He did things someone will not do. Things happened to him and all he felt was "this is it". You cannot imagine.

He had discovered a name for his sensation; _love_. Why you so dumb it took you years. But was he right? He did not know, and still does not. He had good friends that were pushy to make it go further. Here i want to tell you something;

Love is a natural emotion, Lude's life has thought much about it. You don't get to decide when love comes or not. The best part about love is that is obstructs every barrier, you can do all for it. _With great power comes great responsibility._ When love hurts, you can kill or tromatised. You gotta be careful here.
People have different ways of expressing their love so don't get mad. Love should never be taken for granted too.

# The .WHOIS

Lude is a sci-fi person as i mentioned earlier and of course, he likes tech. Lude got more into it as time passed by and became a little good.
Love is very important to him. He has experienced things in his childhood that were good and bad.
He takes security personally and always thought aout the well being of his family. He grew in a home with violence and he never done everything. Growing up, he decided to ignore it and get focus on his hobby most... Reading scientific material and trying to decipher phenomena in this world.

# What did you do !

He met new friends and made plans with them for the future. It had been nice dreaming.
"Hey! See that, seems like _cough_ _cough_ ". Life moves on but things are going to change for you dude.

> Sorry for skipping some parts of the story book but there are some parts i cannot disclosed because it will be so embarrasing to mention that on my blog. I am already doing a lot right now ;)

He became very active.
One of the best things of his life happened, but he did not know yet it was going to change his life and the way he does things. He made a new friend and it was one of his best things so far.
He liked discussing with his new friends.

# Why you so dumb Lude

Why you do this ? Stop talking or you will get hurt. Please discard bro! Get off! What are you looking at?
I bet you would have slapped him! He was behaving so **dumb!**
It should be the past now right. Things are going better.

# Love hurts

This guy here broke his own _magical feeling_ all alone, with his thoughts!
He felt broke, you can't imagine. He decided to keep away from people.
He now thought he was the worst person on earth, he did not merit to be alive. It hurted him everyday of his life. He did not want to converse with anyone . Luck him had some pushy active friends, sometimes he could forget about his thoughts.

Still now, he feels the same time to time. He feels guilty and hurtfull. He prefers to not converse.

# It's Pointless

Yes. This peice of writing seems pointless. It is, it could be. But that does not matter much right?
I have not read this post. I have written it once and i will delete it sooner. I threw on this paper what flew in my mind as my hands were flying on the keyboard.
