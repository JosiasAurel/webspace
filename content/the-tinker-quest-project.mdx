_I just got up from bed_

For some time now, I've had this project that has been itching my mind to build it. The link to the landing page has also been on my profile for a while (tinker.quest) but the project has been in the works for over a year now.

As surprising as that may sound, I still haven't gone anywhere with it. I've had many iterations from scratch of the tool but I've never really come up with something I am satisfied with. Because of this, the tool has spent months having writes and re-writes in C++ and TypeScript. 

But what is tinker.quest?

While in high school, I hated having to read notes in maths and physics without getting to see how the knowledge I would gain or the concepts that were explained applied in real life. Then a few times, I went ahead and played around with concepts that piqued my interest like probability, polar coordinates and the simple pendulum. 
I built simulators for these concepts. A tool to experiment with tossing a coin for probability; a tool for plotting polar coordinates -- which I used to verify if the assignments I did by hand were correct (my maths teacher used it too haha); a 2D simulator for the simple pendulum. 

Building these tools and playing with the variables gave me a better understanding of what these topics were talking about and even better: _help me understand how I can apply them in my life and how they may be used_.

Now I dislike learning things just for the sake of passing exams -- I want to play with the concepts and understand how they work so I can better perceive how they apply in real life.

So essentially, I'm trying to build the tool I wish I had when I was learning in high school: a tool where I can simply build my experiments without having to write everything from scratch over and over again. 

## How I'm going to go about building tinker.quest
The easiest and fastest way will be to build this tool using web technologies and deploy it. [Un]Fortunately, I made my decision early on to build this using a compiled language like C++ or Rust. 
The reason is simple: I want to make the tool to be as accessible as possible.

But Josias, wouldn't it be harder to distribute? 

There are two reasons for that

1.
The goal is to have it run natively on all major platforms _including the web via wasm_.
Coming from a 4GB RAM laptop, it's been painful to run websites sometimes because they're slow and sometimes internet connectivity is a problem so offline availability is a concern for me.

2.
I want to try something new. I've written JavaScript and Python code for a long time. I want to have my brain tickled by memory allocators, shaders and more game dev math. 

I still have other projects on the side where I use JavaScript and Python, but those are reserved for a later time üòÅ.

## When is a test release coming?
I don't know! While I'm learning new things and building this on the side, I cannot tell how long it's going to take before I have something to show for it. Rest assured, I have planned all I'm going to be working on for the next few months. Hopefully, by December I will have something to show. 

## Weekly updates
I will be doing weekly updates like this one every week from now on to keep myself accountable. 
I spend less time on Twitter but I will post a link to the article on my Twitter account for those who follow me.

Have a nice Monday :)
