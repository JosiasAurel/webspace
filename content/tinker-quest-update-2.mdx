It's been a while I haven't written an update regarding Doodle, so here's one.

For the past few weeks, I've been down learning a bit more more systems programming by building small tools and playing with languages in my free time.

I've worked on a tiny parser, and a sudoku solver. While they're not directly related to Doodle, these projects help me get better at systems programming and appreciate how dynamic languages like Python and JavaScript take off a load from us. 

## Discovering Processing and p5.js
While exploring, I re-discovered [Processing](https://processing.org/) and p5.js and played with it a little. I haven't done anything fancy with them yet but I somehow feel relieved. The experience using it is almost exactly the kind I have been expecting to craft in Doodle -- except they've done it already ;-)

However exciting, I still plan to work on Doodle in my free time and to me, this is a testimony that there's space for such tools. 

Next, I plan to begin playing with graphics and hope to have wiggling things on a canvas soon. 
I could easily just [build atop this](https://twitter.com/JosiasWing/status/1684833940148830208?s=20)and call it a day, but I'm a nerd and prefer to remake this from scratch without the bad decisions I've made in the first prototype. 

With all that said, ciao in an indeterminate amount of time till I've something more to share ;)
