As you may have not noticed, I gave a new skin to my website. Yes, I know, it's nicer.

So last night I went to bed in a pretty bad mood. I felt tourmented by all of the 4 commitments I currently have while trying to satisfy my demands for a more sociable life. It's pretty rough and I generally follow a very strict schedule to stay on-track. So much that when I break it, it messes me up entirely. 

For some time, I have made myself used to moving fast and shipping quickly so much that when I do not see gratifying results within a reasonable/expected amount of time, I get worried about the thing. My coffee intake does not help either as it amplifies my anxiety. 

Moreover, knowing I can go 'fast' had made me undertake tasks that I end up slowing down on because of the pressure of trying to deliver all of them soon. That pressure builds up and crushes me on a daily basis.

For the past few months, I had gotten myself used to doing a lot in a day without taking any coffee. After going on and off with it for sometime and observing how my habits changed, I've concluded I'm better off being slow and arguably methodical sometimes in the things I do and my craft in order to be faster.

Initially it sounded strange to me how being slower would make me go faster but here I am, after almost half a year doing it and I'm better than I thought. 

First off, these may sound obvious to you but it wasn't that obvious to me some months and even years ago.

Before talking about slow, I want to highlight what fast was to me.

Fast is rushing things.
Fast is not trying to understand the problem.
Fast is taking a one-sided view at a situation and concluding too soon.
Fast is not preparing, or under-preparing. 
Fast is is not acknowledging long-term and consequences or acknowledging them but still not doing better. 

Disclaimer: I'm not saying being fast is bad. In fact, this article itself was written fast while on my bed. This article is about the benefits of being slow. You HAVE to be fast A LOT of times... but if you can afford to, slow down!

## Eliminate the fuzziness
When trying to be fast, I risk making mistakes that can be very costly in the long run. For example, when I had to make a change to a project, especially in an unfamiliar one, I would just just poke around and dial values here and there until it just "worked". Doing this always had me eye-rolling or jerking at my work because I cannot prove it's right. It would take me hours to patch something together just to then think 'oh wait, this will break here' and have to go back and make some more changes. 

Anything I do not understand well enough haunts and worries me. I cannot solve all the problems in physics but if I can correctly intuit what they're about, it gives me the confidence and assurance I need to move forward in any undertaking that relies on what I already know to be true. Trying to work with a fuzzy mind is hard for me and that's why I try as much as possible to reduce distractions and slow down to understand the problem I have at hand before even diving into a solution. Because I know whatever I would come up with if I don't have a clear mind will most likely be time waisted.

I slow down to have clarity and to validate my thoughts.

## Preparation
Oh dear! The number of times I thought to myself "thank God I read that article" or "yeesh, I should've read the documentation" is a lot. 

By trying to move fast, I always told myself I would learn on the way. While that's true and I really do learn while trying harder all the time. Sometimes it's worth stepping back to read more about what I had at hand gave me a jumpstart I wouldn't get otherwise. 

To write my sudoku-solver in low-level, for example, took me like 2 or 3 days of on/off work. It uses backtracking which I had never implemented and only recalled an excerpt from an article I had read two years ago. I can't emphasize how much I struggled given the little experience I had in low-level languages but I grounded a lot of knowledge about what to do and when.

Arguably, reading about low-level programming could have saved me some time and I would have had more tools to quickly address the problems and blockers I encountered. 

This goes same for presentations, debates, construction and you name it! 

What I (and many other people) failed to realize is that behind that woman effortlessly playing the violin, that guy giving the best talk you've ever listened to or that engineer quickly identifying evaluating a plan for that bridge is a history of struggle and intense preparation. 

And good preparation is done slowly.

## Slow down and say 'No'
People have told me I'm too kind sometimes. When your friend calls you so you can go and play that new game he got and in the mutual excitement you say yes? While you have a pile of unfinished tasks waiting for you to triage. Maybe you should slow down and think for a minute and say 'Look dude, I really have to finish that right now after which I'll have more time to play.'

I've found myself saying no more often to things I would quickly say yes to by slowing down and thinking clearly. 
## Slow doesn't mean perfect
Slow doesn't also mean too slow. In trying to be too fast, you risk really breaking things. Slow means clear.

When I'm talking about doing things slow, I mean taking the time to acknowledge what you're saying and the actions you're about to commit. It means stepping back and appreciating your work. It means re-reading that message you're about to send.

"Does it take me towards my goal?"
"Is this the right thing to do? What consequences could it have?"
"Does it help me to open youtube right now?"

It means if you have to use twenty statements to describe a face, you should do it. Even if it's not perfect, it's clear and clarity matters a lot. 

## Slow means enjoying the process
When I'm writing an article like this, I really do enjoy it. Not because I'm looking out to get thousands of views, no. It is because I get to share my thoughts and I enjoy doing that. 

When I'm slow in what I'm doing, I make sure to enjoy every bit of it. 

Enjoying it means I'm not very worried about it and it means I can do great work too. 

## ...And delivering
And because I have a clear mind, and I'm enjoying it, and I'm prepared, and I'm relaxed, I get to call it 'done'. 

By moving slow, I'm more intentional, organised and perhaps more reasonable in my actions. It helps me build strong foundations and more easily find and acknowledge my errors.
