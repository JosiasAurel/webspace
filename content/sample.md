# This is a simple markdown document

This simple document, can include math expressions using katex as a partial renderer.

Here is a sample math expression as a proof of concept that it is possible like this one $\int 4x^2 dx$ and it works fine

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

If you see some cool math, then it works YAYðŸŽ‰

```python
def hello(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello {name} "
```
