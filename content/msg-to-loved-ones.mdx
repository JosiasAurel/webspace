**Marvels about what has been and what will be.** <br />
**An imperfect human looks up to his God.**

I turn sideways and see you standing there, like a pillar. <br />
I could grip to you and wait for the storm to pass. <br />
You are my support through the hard times <br />
and the good times. <br />

I am ignorant and arrogant. <br />
In my vicious cycle of mental instability, I undermined you. <br />
Yet you stand there, waiting for me to get back to my senses. <br />

You knock me in place with that rock! <br />
Albeit not too hard. <br />
Despite my, perhaps, overly neutral expressions, you commiserate! <br />

Your struggled is mine, <br />
And mine is yours. <br />
I commiserate! <br />

My progress is yours, <br />
And Yours is mine. <br />
We are family. <br />

I make you better. <br />
But you made me better first. <br />
I can't thank you enough! <br />

I asked and you gave, <br />
I called and you came. <br />
I can't thank you enough! <br />

No doubt... your smile shines even in the dark. <br />
it feels me with warmth and energy, <br />
Never stop smiling. <br />

Did I ever tell you that I love you? Perhaps, in my own way quirky way. <br />

I am here for you, <br />
will you be there for me too? <br />

**I love you.**
